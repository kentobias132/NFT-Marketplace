- Optimizing for performance
- Version control using Git
- Testing critical parts of the code

## Project Requirements

1.  **Technology Stack:**

    - TypeScript (required)
    - React
    - Next.js (preferred but not mandatory)

2.  **Code Quality:**

    - Clean, maintainable, and well-documented code is required.
    - Industry best practices for code structure and organization should be followed.
    - Git for version control with regular commits and clear messages.

3.  **Performance:**

3.  **Set environment variables:**

- If your project uses environment variables, create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add required variables there.
- You can look at `.env.example` as an example.

4.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

    This will start the application on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deployment
